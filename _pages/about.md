I was admitted to the Florida Atlantic University College of Business PhD in Business Administration Program in 2017. I major in Finance. I began my Doctoral studies in the Fall term of 2017.

Like most people, my interests are varied and have changed over time. Right now, golf takes up a lot of my limited free time, but I am also active in machine learning, cryptocurrencies, photography and cooking delicious steaks with the 'sous vide' method.

My research interests in Finance are varied, and I expect them to refine as my studies progress. Broadly, I am interested in corporate governance, portfolio theory, risk assessment, and hedge funds. Actually... I am interested in Finance. I like all of it!
